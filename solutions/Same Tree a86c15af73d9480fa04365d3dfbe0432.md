# Same Tree

Difficulty: Easy
Language: Python
N: 100
Related to: BFS, Binary Tree, DFS, Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Example 1:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex1.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex1.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex2.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex2.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

```

**Example 3:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex3.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex3.jpg)

```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `104 <= Node.val <= 104`

**Python Solution:**

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if p is None and q is None:
            return True
        elif p is None or q is None:
            return False
        elif q.val == p.val:
            r = self.isSameTree(q.right, p.right)
            l = self.isSameTree(q.left, p.left)
            return r and l
        return False
```

Related to: String

Given a string `s` consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces, return *the length of the **last** word in the string.*

A **word** is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There will be at least one word in `s`.

**Python Solution:**

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        S = s.strip()
        n = len(S)
        i = n - 1
        while S[i] != ' ' and i >= 0:
            i -= 1
        return n-i-1
```
